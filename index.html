<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
    The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information
    space where documents and other web resources are identified by
    Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links,
    and accessible via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented
    the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990
    while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released
    outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting
    in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
